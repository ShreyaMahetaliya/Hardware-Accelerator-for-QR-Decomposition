QR Decomposition Hardware Accelerator
Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a hardware accelerator for QR decomposition. The project is designed as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) to provide efficient and scalable QR decomposition tailored for scientific and engineering applications.

Modified Gram-Schmidt Algorithm
We chose the Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) algorithm for its robustness and ability to produce more accurate orthogonal matrices compared to the classical Gram-Schmidt process. The MGS algorithm helps in reducing numerical instability and provides sounder values for the orthogonal matrix Q.

Implementation
The project includes the following key components:

QR Decomposition Module: Decomposes a given matrix into an orthogonal matrix 
Q and an upper triangular matrix R.
Fundamental Vector Operations: Includes dot product, normalization, vector multiplication, vector subtraction, and division by scalar.
Control and Data Path Units: Manages the flow of data and control signals to ensure correct execution of the QR decomposition algorithm.
ASIC Implementation: The design is synthesized and laid out from RTL (Register-Transfer Level) to GDSII (Graphic Data System II) using standard VLSI design tools.

Simulation and Synthesis
Submodule Simulation: RTL simulations of individual submodules were performed using tools like Vivado, Quartus/ModelSim, and VCS. All submodules passed their respective simulations.
Architecture Integration Simulation: The complete architecture simulation has been successfully completed and passed. All encountered bugs were resolved.
Synthesis: The synthesized design has been validated for functionality and performance.

Limitations
Despite the robust design, there are some limitations:

Division Module Approximation: Our division module uses approximation, which may affect the precision of the results.
Input Constraints: The current implementation only supports positive integer inputs.
Resource Constraints: The design may face scalability issues with large-scale matrices or real-time processing requirements.

Future Optimization
To enhance the performance and scalability of the QR decomposition module, future optimizations include:

Algorithmic Refinement: Investigate alternative algorithms to reduce computational complexity and improve performance.
Hardware Architecture Optimization: Explore parallel processing techniques, pipelining, and memory hierarchy enhancements.
Verification Methodologies: Implement advanced verification methods like formal verification and constrained-random testing.
Power and Energy Efficiency: Use power-aware design techniques and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS).
Fault Tolerance and Reliability: Enhance fault tolerance mechanisms and error correction codes to improve robustness.
